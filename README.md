# Streamline.js

A modern web UI skin for the Decent Espresso DE1, built on top of [Streamline-Bridge (reaprime)](https://github.com/tadelv/reaprime). This is a full rewrite of the original TCL-based Streamline skin into a browser-native web application — no framework, no bundler, just HTML/CSS/JS served as static files.

## Implemented Features

### Real-Time Shot Visualization
- Live pressure, flow, and group temperature charting via Plotly.js
- Target vs. actual overlay lines (dashed = target)
- Phase step markers and annotations
- Scale weight display during extraction

### Shot Settings Control
- Dose in/out, grind size, brew temperature
- Steam temperature, duration, and flow
- Hot water volume, temperature, duration, and flow
- Pre-shot flush duration and flow
- Mobile-friendly numpad modal with value history from previous shots

### Profile Management
- Browse, search, and select from all available profiles
- 5 quick-access favorite profile slots in the header
- Upload, rename, hide, and delete profiles
- Profile metadata display (author, notes, parameters)

### Profile Editor
- Full in-browser profile editor accessible via EDIT button in the profile selector
- Inline step card editing — 4 steps visible at a time, horizontally scrollable
- Per-step controls: name, temperature (−/+), pump type (Flow/Pressure), rate, transition (fast/smooth), exit condition, and message
- Settings tab: target weight, volume, tank temperature, volume count start, beverage type
- Review tab: plain-English step summaries, profile settings overview, and Plotly graph preview (pressure, flow, temperature scaled to shared y-axis with step boundary markers)
- Auto-suffixes duplicate profile names on save (e.g. "My Profile (2)")
- Saves user-edited copies to the Rea KV store (`/api/v1/store/streamline/{uuid}`) — original default profiles are never modified
- KV-saved profiles are loaded and merged into the profile list on every selector load
- RESET button in the selector right panel: deletes a KV copy and restores selection to the original parent profile, with confirmation dialog

### Shot History
- Paginated shot history backed by IndexedDB
- Tap any past shot to replay its data on the chart
- Per-shot metrics: pre-infusion, extraction, and total phase summaries

### Machine Control
- Start/stop espresso, steam mode, hot water dispensing
- Machine sleep button
- Real-time water tank level display
- DE1 and scale device scan/connect/disconnect
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff on WebSocket drop
- **Non-GHC machine controls** — when connected to a machine without a Group Head Controller, a dedicated right-side column appears with Coffee, Water, Steam, Flush, and Stop buttons; active state visually disables action buttons and highlights Stop in red

### Settings
- **Bluetooth** — scan and connect DE1 and scale; scale auto-connect
- **Calibration** — fan threshold, advanced heater phase flow (DE1 settings)
- **Skin** — light/dark theme toggle; skin switcher (reloads to apply); presence-based auto-sleep with configurable schedule; wake-lock toggle
- **Display** — brightness control and auto-brightness toggle; display size (zoom) selector with localStorage persistence
- **Language** — multi-language support via CSV-based i18n; runtime language switching
- **Extensions** — Decent Visualizer integration (toggle + credentials)
- **REA Settings** — weight/volume flow multipliers; gateway mode selection
- **Updates** — Streamline-Bridge app version, build info, machine firmware version and serial; DE1 firmware file upload
- **User Manual** — links to Decent Espresso support, quickstart, and skin dev docs
- **Talk to Decent** — in-app email support via Decent's API; conversation history; compose new support messages
- **Send Feedback** — bug/feature/general category selector; markdown description editor (EasyMDE); optional Decent account sign-in to tag reports; system info attachment toggle; submits as GitHub issue via Rea Prime
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — reference page for available keyboard shortcuts

### Profile Notes
- Markdown editor (EasyMDE) accessible from the profile editor; full toolbar with bold/italic/headings/lists/links/preview; autosaved per-profile

### UI & UX
- Light/dark theme (persisted in `localStorage`)
- Responsive scaling for landscape tablets and mobile
- Rotation prompt for portrait devices
- Long-press support on +/− buttons for rapid value adjustment

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** [reaprime (Streamline-Bridge)](https://github.com/tadelv/reaprime) must be running and accessible on `localhost:8080`.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd streamline_js

# Serve from the repo root — no build step required
python3 -m http.server
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

**Custom hostname:** If reaprime runs on a different host, set it before loading the app:

```js
localStorage.setItem('reaHostname', '192.168.1.x:8080')
```

## Contributing

See `CLAUDE.md` for coding conventions, API reference (`reaprime_api.md`), and the design system (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`).

Key rules:
- Tailwind + daisyUI only — no custom CSS unless unavoidable
- Use `Plotly.update()`, not `Plotly.react()`, for chart updates
- Profile changes must go through the workflow API wrapper in `api.js`
- IndexedDB writes must be atomic
